# Word analysis in Python

Module for analyzing the word counts inside of a text document (could be a long novel, for example). It counts how many times each word appears, sorts the results by decreasing amounts, and saves it to a file. Too common words (the, of, to, and, ...) are filtered out to make the result more specific to the input file.
